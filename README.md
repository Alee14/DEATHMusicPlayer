* The macOS and Linux versions are currently under development and won't be the most stable experience.
* The macOS version is smashed, will figure out how to fix eventually
* Due to a bug with Avalonia, the Linux version will crash on startup if you don't have certain Microsoft fonts. You can grab them [here.](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-ms-fonts/)
